# How to Share and Install Your Calendar App

Since your application is a single, self-contained file (`index.html`), it is very easy to share and install. Here are the best ways to do it.

## Option 1: The "Professional" Way (GitHub Pages) - Recommended
This is the best method because when you update the code, everyone gets the new version automatically.

1.  **Update GitHub**: Run your `update_github.bat` script to ensure the latest code is online.
2.  **Enable Hosting**:
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub: [https://github.com/dvaugha/FCAL](https://github.com/dvaugha/FCAL)
    *   Click **Settings** (top tab).
    *   Click **Pages** (sidebar on the left).
    *   Under "Branch", select **main** and click **Save**.
3.  **Get the Link**:
    *   Wait about 30-60 seconds. Refresh the page.
    *   GitHub will show you a link at the top (usually `https://dvaugha.github.io/FCAL/`).
    *   **Send this link** to the other person.

## Option 2: The "Simple" Way (File Sharing)
If you don't want to use GitHub, you can simply send the file.

1.  Locate `index.html` in your project folder.
2.  Email this file or send it via USB/Network drive to the other laptop.
3.  Have them save it to a folder (e.g., "My Calendar").

## How to "Install" on Desktop (Chrome / Edge)
This makes the website look and feel like a real native app (removes the browser address bar and gives it a desktop icon).

### Instructions for the User:

1.  **Open the App**:
    *   If using **Option 1**: Open the GitHub link in Chrome or Edge.
    *   If using **Option 2**: Double-click the `index.html` file to open it in Chrome/Edge.
2.  **Create Shortcut**:
    *   **In Chrome**: Click the three dots (⋮) in the top-right corner → **Cast, Save and Share** (or More Tools) → **Create Shortcut...**
    *   **In Edge**: Click the three dots (...) → **Apps** → **Install this site as an app**.
3.  **Configure**:
    *   Name it "FCal Calendar".
    *   **IMPORTANT**: Check the box that says **"Open as window"**.
    *   Click **Create** or **Install**.
4.  **Pin to Taskbar** (Optional):
    *   The app will open in its own clean window.
    *   Right-click the icon in the taskbar and select **"Pin to taskbar"**.

Now they have a "real" app icon on their desktop/taskbar that opens your calendar instantly!
